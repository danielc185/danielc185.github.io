    <h3>More About Me:</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently a student at The College of Staten Island and I am studying computer science.
            Also, I am a returning student and originally majored in Biology. After spending some time
            post-graduation, I decided to come back to school to focus on something that I was much
            more interested in doing. After I receive my degree in Computer Science, I plan to follow
            a career path in either software development or cybersecurity. Overall, I really enjoy
            working with computers and technology and I've always had an interest in these things even
            while I was studying biology, so I am looking forward to what the future holds for me in
            this field!
