    <h3>More About Me:</h3>
        <p style = "font-size: 15px;">
            I am currently a student at The College of Staten Island studying computer science.
            However, my original major was Biology! After spending some time
            post-graduation, I decided to come back to school to focus on something that I was much
            more interested in doing. After being back in college for about a year, I've discovered
            my love and interest for machine learning and artificial intelligence. I really hope
            to use these after I graduate and do something big in the field! Overall, I really enjoy
            working with computers and technology and I've always had an interest in these things even
            while I was studying biology, so I am looking forward to seeing what the future holds for me in
            this field!<br>Outside of school, I love playing piano and guitar and learning new languages. I've studied
            French and Spanish and can speak them quite well, and now I'm working on Italian and Arabic!
