                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Billy Joel has a musical career that spans six decades, starting in 1964. It wasn't until 1971 when he released his first solo album, <i>Cold Spring Harbor. </i>Over the course of his career, he has released 13 studio albums, with his last one in 2001. Fast forward to today, his musical success still continues, despite not actively releasing new music since his last album. Since January 2014, he has held a residency at Madison Square Garden, playing one show per month "as long as the demand continues." Every show has been sold out since then. His 100th show will be March 28, 2024. </p>
